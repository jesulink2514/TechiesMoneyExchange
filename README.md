### 1. DI and IoC üöÄ

Without some king of service locator or Dependency-Injection container your ViewModels have to deal with the dependencies manually and keep up with the changes. That situation is not easy to work with and it is not a good practice.

### 2. Use Cases üíª

Some ViewModels are complex and have a lot of dependencies by nature, even more common in Line-of-Business applications. Use cases are a composition pattern that allows to decouple the ViewModel from the business/interaction logic.

### 3. Fixing Anemic models üíæ

Anemic models is a common problem in the world of software development and it happens when our model is only a data structure and not reprsent the behaviors of the real world object.

### 4. Event Aggregator ‚å®Ô∏è

Sometimes makes sense to decompose a ViewModel into smaller ViewModels and use an Event Aggregator to notify the changes between them.

### 5. Adding Controllers and Interactors ü§ñ

Some controls espcially third-party or community developed controsl don't have a Mvvm orientation and lack Bindable properties. Make those controls work with your VM usually leads to lot of boilerplate code and coupling to the View. Introducing a controller or interactor allow us a better separation of concerns.
